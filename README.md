# Linkedlist-Swift

A linked list is a linear and second most commonly data structure after Arrays, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list.

In this project i implemented basic linked list operations using swift.
  
 - Insertion Operations
  ```
    addFirst
    addLast
    insertAt
    insertAfter
  ```
  
   - Deletion Operations
  ```
    deleteFirst
    deleteLast
    deleteAt
  ```

 - Other Operations
  ```
    printList
    size
    indexOf
    contains
  ```

 - Coding Challenges
  ```
    Reverse Linkedlist
    kthNodeFromEnd
  ```
